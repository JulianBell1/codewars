// This function should test if the factor is a factor of base.

// Return true if it is a factor or false if it is not.
// About factors

// Factors are numbers you can multiply together to get another number.

// 2 and 3 are factors of 6 because: 2 * 3 = 6

//     You can find a factor by dividing numbers. If the remainder is 0 then the number is a factor.
//     You can use the mod operator (%) in most languages to check for a remainder

// For example 2 is not a factor of 7 because: 7 % 2 = 1

// Note: base is a non-negative number, factor is a positive number.


function checkForFactor (base, factor) {
    if (base % factor === 0 || factor % base === 0){
      return true
    }
    else {
      return false
    }
  }



// Messi goals function

// Messi is a soccer player with goals in three leagues:
  
//     LaLiga
//     Copa del Rey
//     Champions
  
// Complete the function to return his total number of goals in all three leagues.

// Note: the input will always be valid.

// For example:

// 5, 10, 2  -->  17

function goals (laLigaGoals, copaDelReyGoals, championsLeagueGoals) {
    return laLigaGoals + copaDelReyGoals + championsLeagueGoals
